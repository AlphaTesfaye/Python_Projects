# Computer Quiz

This Python script is a simple computer quiz game that tests your knowledge of computer-related terms and acronyms. It presents a series of questions and evaluates the user's answers to calculate their score.

## Instructions

1. **Welcome Message:** The game starts with a welcome message inviting the user to play.
2. **Prompt to Play:** The user is asked whether they want to play the quiz. If they decline, the game quits.
3. **Quiz Start:** If the user chooses to play, the quiz begins.
4. **Questions and Answers:** The quiz consists of several multiple-choice questions about computer terms and acronyms. The user inputs their answer for each question.
5. **Scoring:** For each correct answer, the user earns a point. The final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

## Quiz Questions

The quiz questions cover various topics related to computer terminology and acronyms. Here are some examples:

1. What does APU stand for?
2. What does ILS stand for?
3. What does VOR stand for in aviation?

# Number Guessing Game

This Python script is a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## How the Game Works

1. **User Input:** The game prompts the user to input the upper limit of the range for the random number.
2. **Input Validation:** The script validates the user's input to ensure it is a positive integer.
3. **Random Number Generation:** Using the `random.randint()` function, a random number within the specified range is generated.
4. **Guessing Loop:** The game enters a loop where the player makes guesses.
5. **Guess Evaluation:** After each guess, the script compares the player's guess to the randomly generated number and provides feedback (higher, lower, or correct).
6. **Game Termination:** The loop continues until the player correctly guesses the number. The game then terminates, displaying the number of guesses made.

## How to Run

To play the game:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download the Python script (`number_guessing_game.py`) from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script by executing the command `python number_guessing_game.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Features
- **Input Validation:** The script validates user input to ensure it is a positive integer.
- **Random Number Generation:** The game generates a random number within the specified range using the `random.randint()` function.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** After each guess, the player receives feedback on whether their guess was higher, lower, or correct.
- **Guess Counter:** The script keeps track of the number of guesses made by the player and displays it at the end of the game.
